# NLP---Doc-Similarity-with-Creative-Pitch-Data
I am learning Document Similarity and what different methods can be used.

# The different Similarity Methods:
1. Cosine Similarity
2. Euclidean Distance
3. Jaccard Similarity
4. K-means
5. LSI
6. LDA
7. Jensen-Shannon Distance
8. Word Mover Distance
9. Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)
10. Universal Sentence Encoder
11. Siamese Manhattan LSTM
12. Dot Product
13. Knowledge-based Measures
14. Semantic Similarity

These methods from my understanding can be combined and mixed and matched with different vectorizers, lemma's, stemm's, and so on. Each use case will differ so it is best to find what works for each individual use case.
